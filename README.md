# Chip8 Emulator

## Description
This is an emulator for the Chip8 architecture. A work in progress, so not much here yet.

## TODO (pretty much everything at this point)
* Emulate instructions
* Hook up timers
* Show state of VM
* Allow pausing and single-stepping
* Show disassembly of instructions
* Add sound
